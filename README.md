## What is Disposable Cloud Environment (DCE)?

The Disposable Cloud Environment (DCE) is a mechanism for providing temporary, limited Amazon Web Services (AWS)
accounts. Accounts can be "leased" for a period of seven days (by default). After the time has expired, the 
account is _reset_ and returned to a pool of accounts to be leased again.

At a high-level, DCE consists of [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions (implemented in [Go](https://golang.org/)), 
[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables, 
[Amazon Simple Notifcation Servce (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) topics,
and APIs exposed with [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/). 
These resources are created in the AWS account using [Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

## Implementing DCE

This repository provides a set of components which implementors (you) can use to deploy your own DCE instance. 
These components come in the form of:

- Terraform modules to deploy DCE infrastructure to AWS
- Packaged go modules and other assets, to deploy to Lambda, CodeBuild, etc. to your AWS master account

With these resources deployed, you will have access to a set of _integration points_, for working with your DCE instance:

- APIs for managing DCE resources (accounts, leases, etc.)
- SNS topics, allowing you hook in to DCE events, and implement your own custom business logic

### Requirements

Before you can deploy DCE into your account, you will need the following:

- An AWS account to serve as the master account.
- Terraform 0.12+
- Go 1.12+
- GNU Make 3.81+

To run the `terraform init` command later, make sure that you have API access
to your AWS account. To double-check your AWS API credentials, you can use
the `aws configure` command as shown here:

```bash
$ aws configure list
      Name                    Value             Type    Location
      ----                    -----             ----    --------
   profile                <not set>             None    None
access_key                <not set>             None    None
secret_key                <not set>             None    None
    region                <not set>             None    None
```

This output shows an account that _has not yet been initialized_.
If your configuration looks like this, make sure to configure 
your API and CLI access before continuing. See [Configurating the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
to learn how to configure the CLI and API credentials.

### Deploying DCE

To deploy DCE into your master account, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:Optum/DCE.git
    ```
1. Change into the repository directory.
    ```bash
    $ cd DCE
    ```
1. Run `make deploy_local` to build and deploy the artifacts to your AWS account.
    ```bash
    $ make deploy_local
    ...

    ```

Once the last command has completed successfully, you will have DCE deployed in your AWS account!

### Using the DCE API

_TODO_

### Integrating with DCE

DCE provides a number of SNS topics, which allow you to hook into DCE events, and implement your own custom business logic. Out of the box, DCE is unopinionated about how you manage the details of your DCE accounts. Some questions which are left to you to answer are:

- How do you grant and remove access to AWS Accounts?
- What do you do when an account reaches a budget threshold?

To answers to these questions, you can subscribe to SNS topics provided by DCE. For example, you could subscribe to the _Lease Added_ topic, create an IAM User, and email an invite to the lease principal to login. On _Lease Removed_, you might delete that IAM User, and notify the lease principal that they no longer have access.

See the [SNS Topic Reference](#sns-topic-reference) for details on available SNS topics.

### Integrating with Identity Providers

When a new AWS account is added to the pool, [a role is created to allow principal users to login to the account](#adding-aws-accounts-to-the-dcs-account-pool), designated by the `adminRoleArn` field on the account object. By default, this role has an Assume Role Policy allowing IAM principals from the same account to assume it.

To integrate with alternative identity providers, you may [modify the Assume Role Policy on the IAM role.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html). You may listen to events on the [account-created SNS topic](#account-created), which include the `principalRoleArn` in the message body.

#### Example: Vanilla DCE Integration

_TODO: what's the simplest / least opinionated approach to integrating with DCE_




### Configuring aws-nuke

In order to reset AWS accounts, DCE uses the [open source `aws-nuke` tool](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke). This tool tries its darndest to delete every single resource in your account, and will make several attempts to ensure everything is wiped clean.

To prevent `aws-nuke` from deleting certain resources, you may provide a YAML configuration with a list of resource _filters_. (see [`aws-nuke` docs for the YAML filter configuration syntax](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke#filtering-resources)). By default, DCE filters out resources which are critical to running DCE -- for example, the IAM roles for your account's `adminRoleArn` / `principalRoleArn`.

As a DCE implementor, you may have additional resources you wish protect from `aws-nuke`. If this is the case, you may specify your own custom `aws-nuke` YAML configuration:

- Copy the contents of [`default-nuke-config-template.yml`](./cmd/codebuild/reset/default-nuke-config-template.yml) into your own file, and modify as needed.
  - See [`aws-nuke` docs for the YAML `filters` configuration syntax](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke#filtering-resources) 
- Upload your YAML configuration file to an S3 bucket
- Set the Terraform `reset_nuke_template_bucket` and `reset_nuke_template_key` to point at your YAML configuration file on S3
- Make sure [you have aws-nuke enabled](#enabling-aws-nuke)

#### Template parameters for aws-nuke YAML configuration

DCE allows you to use a number of template parameters within your `aws-nuke` YAML config, which will be resolved a runtime:

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `{{id}}` |  The AWS Account ID, for the account currently being nuked |
| `{{admin_role}}` |  The name of the IAM role assumed by the DCE master account to manage the child account. |
| `{{principal_role}}` |  The name of the IAM role assumed by end users of DCE, in order to login to their AWS account |
| `{{principal_policy}}` | The IAM policy assigned the the `principal_role` |



#### Enabling aws-nuke

By default, `aws-nuke` is set to execute in _Dry Run_ mode, so that you don't accidentally destroy critical resources in your AWS account. To enable `aws-nuke`, you will need to set the Terraform `reset_nuke_toggle` variable to `"true"`. 

## Usage

### Adding AWS Accounts to the DCE Account Pool

To add an account to the DCE Account Pool, you may use the `POST /accounts` endpoint.

eg.

```
POST /accounts
{
  "id": "123456789012"
  "adminRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/DCEAdmin"
}

Response:
{
  "id": "1234567890",
  "accountStatus": "NotReady",
  "adminRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::1234567890123:role/adminRole",
  "principalRoleArn":  "arn:aws:iam::1234567890123:role/DCEPrincipal",
  "principalPolicyHash": "",
  "createdOn": 1560306008,
  "lastModifiedOn": 1560306008,
  "metadata": {}
}
```

The IAM Role passed in as `adminRoleArn` must be assumable by the DCE master account, and have appropriate IAM access to manage the DCE Account (eg. can run [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke) in the account).

When adding the account to the pool, the account will be marked as `NotReady`, and queued for reset. You will need to wait for reset to complete and the account to be marked as `Ready` before requesting leases against the account.

DCE will create a new IAM Role to be assumed by principal users of the account. The ARN for this role will be included in the response, as `principalRoleArn`. The principal's role has near-admin access to the account, with the following exceptions:

- Cannot create resources which cannot be deleted by DCE
- Cannot create support tickets, or increase service limits
- Is restricted to `us-east-1` and `us-west-1`
- Cannot modify resources managed by DCE (including itself)

See [_Integrating with Identity Providers_](#integrating-with-identity-providers) for documentation on assuming the DCE principal role using an identity provider.

### Authenticating into DCE Accounts

## API Reference

DCE exposes an API for managing DCE accounts and leases.

See [swagger.yaml](./modules/swagger.yaml) for endpoint documentation (better Swagger docs to come...).

### API Location

The API is hosted by AWS API Gateway. The base URL is exposed as a Terraform output. To retrieve the base url of the API, run the following command from your Terraform module directory:

```
terraform output api_url
```

### Authorization

The DCE API is authorized via IAM. To access the API, you must have access to an IAM principal with [appropriate IAM access to execute the API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-iam-policy-examples-for-api-execution.html).

All API requests must be signed with Signature Version 4. See [AWS documentation for signing requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html).

#### Cognito

Cognito is used to allow an admin to add users to DCE.  This can be done by using the Cognito User Pool.  Additionally any IdP supported by Cognito User Pools can also be used.

#### Roles

##### Admins

Admins have full control to all APIs and will not get back filtered results when querying APIs. 

There are three different ways a user is considered an admin:

1. They have an IAM user/role/etc with a policy that gives them access to the API
1. A Cognito user is placed into a Cognito group called `Admins`
1. A Cognito user has an attribute in `custom:roles` that will match a search criteria specified by the Terraform variable `cognito_roles_attribute_admin_name`

##### Users

Users (by default) are given access to the leasing and usage APIs.  This is done so they can request their own lease and look at the usage of their leases.  Any appropriately authenticated user in Cognito will automatically fall into the `Users` role.

#### IAM Policy for DCE API requests

The IAM principal used to send requests to the DCE API must have sufficient permissions to execute API requests.

The Terraform module in the repo provides an IAM policy with appropriate permissions for executing DCE API requests. You can access the policy name and ARN as Terraform outputs.

```
terraform output api_access_policy_name
terraform output api_access_policy_arn
```

#### IAM Policy for DCE Accounts

The Terraform module will come with a sane starting policy that is applied to the IAM principal.  This policy is applied when a new account is added or when a lease is unlocked.  It is possible to change the policy to what is needed by providing the Terraform variable `dcs_principal_policy`.  The value of this variable is a location of a policy file that can be a Go template.  It is uploaded into S3 and is read from there as the policy is applied.

#### Signing requests in Go

The AWS SDK for Go exposes a [`signer/v4` package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/signer/v4/), which may be used to sign API requests. For example:

```go
import (
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/credentials"
	sigv4 "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/signer/v4"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func sendRequest(method, endpoint) (http.Response, error) {
	// Create an API request
	req, err := http.NewRequest(method, apiUrl+endpoint, nil)
  if err != nil {
  	return nil, err
  }

	// Load credentials from env vars, or a credentials file
	awsCreds := credentials.NewChainCredentials([]credentials.Provider{
    &credentials.EnvProvider{},
    &credentials.SharedCredentialsProvider{Filename: "", Profile: ""},
  })

	// Sign the request
	signer := sigv4.NewSigner(awsCreds)
	signedHeaders, err := signer.Sign(req, nil, "execute-api", "us-east-1", time.Now())
	if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }

	// Send the API request
	return http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
}
```

#### Signing requests in Python

See AWS docs with [example code for signing requests in Python](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-signed-request-examples.html).

Alternatively, you could consider open-source libraries like [aws-requests-auth](https://github.com/DavidMuller/aws-requests-auth) for signing requests.

#### Signing requests in Postman

See AWS docs for [sending signed requests in Postman](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-use-postman-to-call-api.html)

**Assumes that it runs in the root directory of the repo.**

Bash script to unit test all Go projects and build all executables in the
`cmd` directory, and generate the `bin/build_artifacts.zip` and
`bin/terraform_artifacts.zip` containing individual zipped executables and
Terraform files.

Requirements

- [Go v1.12.1](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [golangci-lint v1.16.0](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases/tag/v1.16.0)

Artifacts

- `bin/lambda/`
  - Executables and Zips generated from Golang Lambda Functions in
    `cmd/lambda/`. Gets removed at the end.
- `bin/codebuild/`
  - Executables and Zips generated from Golang CodeBuild functions
    in `cmd/codebuild/`. Gets removed at the end.
- `bin/build_artifacts.zip`

  - The Build Artifact Zip file containing all the generated Zips from
    `bin/lambda/` and `bin/codebuild/`. - `lambda` - `acctmgr.zip` - `financelock.zip` - `resetsqs.zip` - `resettrigger.zip` - `codebuild` - `reset.zip`

## Build & Deploy

Run `make build` to compile all lambdas under the `functions` directory.
This will produce the binaries (as well as the zips that can be uploaded to the
AWS console for manual deployment) in the `bin` directory. See the `deploy.sh`
above for automated deployment.

## Database Schema

**DCEAccount<Namespace>** Table

Status of each Account in our pool

```
{
    "Id": "123456789012", # *Unique AWS Account ID*
    "AccountStatus": "Leased" | "Ready" | "NotReady"
    "LastModifiedOn": 1555690626 # *Epoch Timestamp*
}
```

Hash Key: `Id`
Range Key: `AccountStatus`

**DCELease<Namespace>** Table

Current state of a users lease to a AWS Account.
Records are unique by AccountId+PrincipalId.

```
{
  "AccountId":  "123456789012", # AWS Account ID
  "PrincipalId": "098765432",
  "Id" "4585fca7-cb21-406b-b778-83dccb351354",
  "LeaseStatus": "Active" | "FinanceLock" | "ResetLock" | "ResetFinanceLock" | "Decommissioned"
  "CreatedOn": 1555690626 # *Epoch Timestamp*
  "LastModifiedOn": 1555690626 # *Epoch Timestamp*
  "BudgetAmount": 300
  "BudgetCurrency": "USD"
  "BUdgetNotificationEmail": ["user@test.com", "manager@test.com"]
}
```

Hash Key: `AccountId`
Range Key: `LeaseStatus`

Secondary Index: PrincipalId
Secondary Range Key: PrincipalId

**UsageCache<Namespace>** Table

Usage cost of lease per day is stored in this table.

```
{
  "AccountId": "123456789012", # *Unique AWS Account ID*
  "CostAmount": 24.00, # *usage cost amount*
  "CostCurrency": "USD", # *usage cost currency*
  "EndDate": 1568678399, # *Epoch Timestamp*
  "PrincipalId": "TestUser1", # *User principal ID*
  "StartDate": 1568592000, # *Epoch Timestamp*
  "TimeToLive": 1571184000 # ttl attribute - Epoch Timestamp*
}
```

Hash Key: `StartDate`
Range Key: `PrincipalId`

## Database Backups

DCE does not backup your DynamoDB tables by default. However, if you want to restore a DynamoDB table from a backup, we do provide a helper script in [scripts/restore_db.sh](./scripts/restore_db.sh). This script is also provided as a Github release artifact, for easy access.

To restore a DynamoDB table from a backup:

```
# Grab the account table name from Terraform state
table_name=$(cd modules && terraform output accounts_table_name)

# Or, grab the leases table name
table_name=$(cd modules && terraform output leases_table_name)

# List available backups
./scripts/restore_db.sh \
  --target-table-name ${table_name} \
  --list-backups

# Choose an backup from the output of the last command, and pass in the ARN
./scripts/restore_db.sh \
  --target-table-name ${table_name} \
  --backup-arn <backup arn>

# If the table already exists, and you want to delete and
# recreate it from a backup, pass in
# the --force-delete-table flag
./scripts/restore_db.sh \
  --target-table-name ${table_name} \
  --backup-arn <backup arn> \
  --force-delete-table
```

After restoring your DynamoDB table from a backup, you should rerun `terraform apply` to ensure that your table is in sync with your Terraform configuration.

## Reset

AWS DCE Reset will process an AWS DCE Account to a clean and secure state.
The Reset has 2 main procedures, clearing the resources in an account (**Nuke**).

The Reset of an account is done through a CodeBuild stage in a CodePipeline.

### Nuke

To clear resources from an AWS DCE Account, [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke)
is used to list out all nuke-able resources and remove them. The defualt
configuration file used to filter resources to not delete is located
[here](cmd/codebuild/reset/default-nuke-config-template.yml). The
configuration file can also be pulled from an S3 Bucket Object via setting
the `RESET_NUKE_TEMPLATE_BUCKET` and `RESET_NUKE_TEMPLATE_KEY`, these are
default to `STUB` and are ignored.

### Alarms/Alerting

Cloudwatch alarms are defined in modules/alarms.tf, all alarms deliver to the SNS topic defined in modules/alarms_sns.tf.  
Alarms are defined based upon metrics available for each resource, [Metrics and Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html).
They will vary by each service, please refer to the documentation above to create/modify Alarms/Alerts.

## Account Provisioning & Decommissioning

## Notification via SES

This repo makes use of the Simple Email Service from AWS, which requires a verified email addrss for the functionality being used.
To allow for this, the email address configured in the terraform requires a confirmation to made manually upon the applicaiton of the email
address to the account.

The address MUST reply to a confirmation email sent from SES to verify the account before emails can commence.  

## Budget Features

### Budget Notifications

Budget notifications will be sent out of a verified Simple Email Service account.  Verification of this address is a manual process, see above
"Notification via SES" section.
Some variables used in notification templates (conatined in modules/variables.tf):
  - IsOverBudget : Boolean determining account budget status
  - Lease.PrincipalID : The UserID of the lease holder
  - Lease.AccountID : The Account number of the AWS account in use
  - Lease.BudgetAmount : The configured budget amount for the lease
  - ActualSpend : The calculated spend on the account at time of notification
  - ThresholdPercentile : The conigured threshold percentage for the notification, prior to exhaustion
