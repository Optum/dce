**v0.13.0 Migration Notes**

This release removes a number of Optum-specific configurations from the default aws-nuke YAML configuration. If you want to keep these configurations in your implementation of Redbox, you will need to specify an _override_ nuke config as part of Optum's deployment of Redbox.

To specify a override nuke config, upload your own YAML file to an S3 bucket, and specify the S3 location using the `reset_nuke_template_bucket` and `reset_nuke_template_key` Terraform variables.

This release also disables `aws-nuke` by default, to prevent accidental destruction of critical AWS account resources. To re-enable `aws-nuke`, set the `reset_nuke_toggle` Terraform variable to `"true"`. 

See [README.md for details](./README.md#configuring-aws-nuke) on aws-nuke configuration
