# Disposable Cloud Environment<sup>TM</sup>

> **DCE<sup>TM</sup> is your playground in the cloud**

DCE helps you quickly and safely explore the public cloud by managing temporary AWS accounts. 

Common use cases for a public cloud account include: 
- Developing, testing, or operating cloud networks and applications
- Improving infrastructure utilization with autoscaling 
- Leveraging cloud-native developer tooling 
- Exploring data with analytical and machine learning services 
- And much [more](https://aws.amazon.com/)! 

DCE users can "lease" an AWS account for a defined period of time and with a limited budget. 

At the end of the lease, or if the lease's budget is reached, the account is wiped clean and returned to the account pool so it may be leased again.
