# Disposable Cloud Environment (DCE)

The Disposable Cloud Environment (DCE) provides temporary, limited Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts. Accounts can be "leased" for a period of time or up to a pre-determined budget amount. When the period of time is reached or the maximum budgeted amount is exceeded, the lease is expired. The leased account is _reset_ and returned to a pool of accounts to be leased again.

At a high-level, DCE consists of [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions (implemented in [Go](https://golang.org/)), 
[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables, 
[Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) topics,
and APIs exposed with [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/). 
These resources are created in the AWS account using [Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

## Why DCE?

> **DCE is your playground in the cloud**

With a DCE account, you have a safe environment to experiment with in the
cloud. With near-administrative access to an AWS account, you
can click around the AWS web console or run AWS CLI commands from your terminal. 
As a developer in an organization, you don't need to worry about cost management or orphaned resources.

### Budget limits

DCE can be configured to expire account _leases_ (see [Concepts documentation](concepts.md)) 
based on a budgeted amount for usage. 

Once the account hits a weekly spending limit, the account will be automatically
wiped clean so there are no surprise bills at the end of the month.

### Timed leases

DCE contains the concept of _expiring leases_. A _lease_ represents temporary
access to an account for a certain amount of time. Once the lease is expired,
the AWS account is cleaned of all of the resources and returned to the pool
for other people to lease.
